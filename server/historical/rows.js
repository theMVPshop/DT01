This month, designers seem to have hit the minimalism button hard. There is a bit of variety in there, but if you like lots of white space, you're in luck. A few Powerpoint-ish sites, too. Enjoy! Note: I'm judging these sites by how good they look to me. If they're creative and original, or classic but really well-done, it's all good to me. Sometimes, UX and accessibility suffer. For example, many of these sites depend on JavaScript to display their content at all; this is a Bad Idea™, kids. If you find an idea you like and want to adapt to your own site, remember to implement it responsibly. Steve Mcgugan Steve Mcgugan has a name that is a lot of fun to say out loud, the first Drupal site we've had on this list in a while, and a quite minimalist approach to showing off his work. It's clean, it's pretty, and it's mostly monochromatic with just a splash of green here and there. Classic and effective.

Or you could simplify the process and grab a dedicated color picker tool that will allow you to grab color from any website, on desktop or on mobile without having to leave your browser window. Here are 10 best color pickers that will make it easy to save color palettes. 1. Instant Eyedropper Instant Eyedropper is a free Windows-only tool that makes it easy to grab a color from anywhere on your screen. Once you install this lightweight app, it will sit in your system tray. All you have to do is click its icon and choose a color, then the app will copy the code to your clipboard. The app supports the following color code formats: HTML, HEX, Delphi Hex, Visual Basic Hex, RGB, HSB, and Long. 2.

Web hosting is a critical part of every website, whether you're building on a self-hosted platform like WordPress or a hosted one like Wix. Nevertheless, the choices your clients make with regards to web hosting can affect what you're able to do for them. If you're not part of the web hosting conversation, then you at least need a good understanding of how their decision will dictate what exactly you can build on top of their chosen hosting plan. Here's what you need to know. Does Web Hosting Affect How You Design a Website? The answer to that is very much 'Yes'. Web hosting doesn't just affect the kind of website you build either.

Will I be happy here?At Hired, we believe there is an art and science to evaluating and negotiating a job offer, and it starts with data. Throughout the session, we will reference real data based on millions of dollars of offers from thousands of companies. We facilitate the job search process from the initial interview request all the way to the final job offer, so we have unprecedented visibility into salaries and demand across a variety of cities, positions, and companies. We’re excited to put our data to work: helping you land a job you love — with the salary you deserve.

We've had a few weeks to poke around, and check out the new features, and more importantly the now deprecated features. What we found was a modern library that defied a few of our expectations. It's Not Bloated There are quite a few myths built up around jQuery, not least that it is bloated and slow. There's some sense to this, containing as it does code that you probably won't need. However this is true of all libraries, frameworks, and 3rd party scripts; unless you're using something so niche that there is nothing superfluous wrapped up in the code, then there will always be a few bytes here and there that aren't required.

Having Twitter as one of the main marketing channels is not only going to help build awareness of your brand but can also drive traffic to your website and make your articles go viral. How can this be achieved? Well, it's a pretty straightforward tactic that some of the top bloggers are using. The idea is that within your blog post you have short pieces of content that are catchy and people like them. Those pieces of content can then be easily tweeted.

It looks and functions exactly like the wireframe. Everyone on the design team has praised the project. The client hates it, but they can't explain why. The culprit might be color. Different colors can evoke such strong emotions that people have sharp reactions to them. It's part personal preference, part psychological, and even part social norms. Understanding these tendencies and user preferences can greatly impact user experience. Here's what you need to know. User Expectations and Preferences User experience starts with the type of user your website or app is designed for. Basic demographics such as gender or region where a user lives can impact their perception of your design based on color. (You can read more about color and cultural considerations here.) One of the most interesting impacts from color on UX is linked to gender.

But your users aren't going to put on some music and 'buckle down' to finish browsing your website, they need to be drawn in. The Call to Action—that 'Buy' button, for example—needs to look good. 1. Contrast The first and easiest way to catch the eye is to use contrast. By 'contrast', I mean that the important elements of a design need to stand out from the rest in a meaningful way. See what I did there? Now, there are several kinds of contrast to discuss: Light/dark contrast Color contrast Size contrast Contrasting styles Most of these are fairly self explanatory, but let's go over them.

Tools like Google Lighthouse have been built to emphasize performance precisely because it is so important to user experience, and by association, to search engine ranking. The speed of a website is determined by numerous factors, but the single greatest is the volume of data that needs to be transmitted across the web; large file sizes mean slow load times. One of the biggest culprits when it comes to file size, and slow sites, is images. A large JavaScript file might use up 4kb of space uncompressed, but even if you can reduce its size by 75% by compressing it, you've still only saved 3kb. An image on the other hand, may easily be 500kb, if you can reduce its size by just 25% you'll save 125kb. Making compressing the image 40 times more effective than compressing the Javascript; when it comes to speeding up your site, the place to focus your attention is your images. One of the most popular solutions to images" , "https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2019/11/is-it-time-to-start-using-an-image-cdn/" , "images/featured_scientiamobile-1024x563.png"],
