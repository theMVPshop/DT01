We`ve had a few weeks to poke around, and check out the new features, and more importantly the now deprecated features. What we found was a modern library that defied a few of our expectations.

However this is true of all libraries, frameworks, and 3rd party scripts; unless you`re using something so niche that there is nothing superfluous wrapped up in the code, then there will always be a few bytes here and there that aren`t required.

Having Twitter as one of the main marketing channels is not only going to help build awareness of your brand but can also drive traffic to your website and make your articles go viral. How can this be achieved? Well, it`s a pretty straightforward tactic that some of the top bloggers are using. The idea is that within your blog post you have short pieces of content that are catchy and people like them. Those pieces of content can then be easily tweeted.
